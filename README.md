# What is this?
This is just me having fun and try to answer some questions about topics that I am curious about.

## What is in it?
There are main projects:
* F1: I started this by trying to answer the question 'Is it true that Formula 1 is more boring nowadays?
  If so, what makes a race more predictable? Is it possible to predict the outcome of a race using historical data?
  While I am still working on the prediction part, I worked on visuals and metrics for the first two questions.

* Weather: we have a saying in Italy - or at least in Rome - about the weather being always awful on Good
  Monday. I have analysed historical data from different italian regions across different years to understand the
  correlation with the time of the year and spot potential anomalies.

* Movies: I am a big movie fan. However this section is the least developed. At the moment there is only one
  little script about Western Movies to get an idea on how the attention and enthusiasm around them changed over the
  years.

* Tennis: is tennis becoming more predictable these days?
